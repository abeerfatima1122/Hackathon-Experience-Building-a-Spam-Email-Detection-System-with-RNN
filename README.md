# Spam Email Detection using RNN

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a **Spam Email Detection System** built using **RNN**. The model classifies emails as spam or not spam based on text features. It was developed as part of a **hackathon on February 16, 2025**.

## 📌 Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Removed noise, handled missing values, and normalized text.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized patterns and class distributions.
- **Deep Learning Model (ResNet)**: Achieved **94.72% train accuracy** and **94.32% test accuracy**.
- **Deployment**: Implemented using **Streamlit** for a user-friendly interface.
